# JUCE Sequencer
This project is a simple oscillator sequencer made in JUCE. It enables users to add and remove notes to a predefined table via GUI.  

## Features
- Specifying size of note.
- Grid size and note length.
- Music time (i.e. 3/4, 4/4 ect.).
- Wavetable oscillators: Sine, saw-tooth, square, triangle and noise.
- Vibrato effect via frequency modulation. 

Due to shear size of the project and at the time the lack of knowledge in C++ object oriented programming as well as JUCE framework the sequencer remained quite simple. Amongst others - tempo for example cannot be set as well as the display for user modified wavetable has not been implemented (only outline is present). Envelope and other sound effect also are not fully integrated.  

## Results 
Result showing GUI of the sequencer.
